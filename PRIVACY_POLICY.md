# Kanjiholic: Privacy policy

Welcome to Kanjiholic, an Flashcard App to study, practice and memorize all your favorite kanjis, because we are kanjiholics.

This is an open source Android app developed by Rodrigo Diaz Lupanow. The source code is on GitLab under MIT license. the app is also available on Google Play.

The goal of this app is to group the Kanjis that you are practicing and iterate them in random order. You can have as many groups and cards as you want.

To use it, simply register and sign in. It is totally free and open source.

It is my first App to publish and the goal is to improve the quality step by step. It is a project under development so you may find bugs or thing to improve, if so, please be kind to share them with me.

I hope your Kanji knowledge increses using this app.

Yours sincerely,
